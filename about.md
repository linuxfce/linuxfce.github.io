This is the About Me section, I'm currently learning HTML, CSS, JScript, I work with Bootstrap, JQuery, currently learning how to host my blog with static pages [Jekill](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/quickstart/) on [GitHub](https://linuxfce.github.io/) so I can do simple websites or blogs for my friends and neighbours maintaining a website without CMS or any databases or any coding skills.

### More Information
