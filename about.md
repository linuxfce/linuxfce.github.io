### This is the About Me section ###

 I'm currently learning HTML, CSS, JScript, I work with Bootstrap, JQuery, currently learning how to host my blog with static pages [Jekill](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/quickstart/) on [GitHub](https://linuxfce.github.io/), so I can do simple websites or blogs  that my friends and neighbours can easily maintain a website without CMS, databases, coding skills or even how to host their own website.

In the main page I call myself a Web Developer which is not really true, I'm still learning HTML, CSS \(\+ SASS\), JScritp, JQuery, Bootstrap, Node.Js, Markdown syntax, Jekill, GitHub &amp; Git, till today, I managed to host &amp; maintain my own website [miguelpcrepairs](http://miguelpcrepairs.site90.net/) and this [Blog](https://linuxfce.github.io/). 

 I'm also trying to work with Firefox new addons **WebExtensions API**, in order to migrate some of my old addons, build with the old sdk, to the new **WebExtensions API**, a cross-browser system for developing extensions. To a large extent the system is compatible with the extension API supported by Google Chrome and Opera and the W3C Draft Community Group. Extensions written for these browsers will in most cases run in Firefox or Microsoft Edge with just a few changes. The API is also fully compatible with multiprocess Firefox.

 GitHub even offers their own version control like Git which is also included and supported.
