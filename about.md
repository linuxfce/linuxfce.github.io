### This is the About Me section ###

 I'm currently learning HTML, CSS, JScript, I work with Bootstrap, JQuery, currently learning how to host my blog with static pages [Jekill](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/quickstart/) on [GitHub](https://linuxfce.github.io/), so I can do simple websites or blogs  that my friends and neighbours can easily maintain a website without CMS, databases, coding skills or even how to host their own website.

In the main page I call myself a Web Developer which is not really true, I'm still learning HTML, CSS \(\+ SASS\) and till today, I barely managed to host &amp; maintain my own website [miguelpcrepairs](http://miguelpcrepairs.site90.net/) and this [Blog](https://linuxfce.github.io/).

 GitHub even offers their own version control like Git which is also included and supported.

### More Information

#### I'm also learning how to code at [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/linuxfce)
