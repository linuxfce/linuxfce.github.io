This is the About Me section, I'm currently learning HTML, CSS, JScript, I work with Bootstrap, JQuery, currently learning how to host my blog with static pages [Jekill](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/quickstart/) on [GitHub](https://linuxfce.github.io/), so I can do simple websites or blogs  that my friends and neighbours can easily maintain a website without CMS, databases, coding skills or even how to host their website.

 GitHub even offers their own version control like Git which is also included and supported.

### More Information

#### I'm also lerning how to code at [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/linuxfce)
